            <h2>About the Game</h2>
            <p>Welcome to <strong>Busy Worker Run</strong>, the ultimate test of reflexes for the modern professional. In this fast-paced infinite runner, you play as a diligent office worker trying to navigate the chaotic city streets to get to work on time. It's not just a run; it's a battle against the urban elements!</p>
            
            <h3>The Story</h3>
            <p>Every morning is a new challenge. The sidewalk is treacherous, filled with spilled <strong>Coffee</strong> that can ruin your shoes, hungry <strong>Pigeons</strong> taking flight at the worst moments, and reckless <strong>Electric Scooters</strong> zooming past on the wrong side of the road. Your goal is simple: Run as far as you can, dodge every obstacle, and achieve the highest score possible.</p>
