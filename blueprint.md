# Dinner Menu Recommender

## Overview

This project is a simple web application that recommends a dinner menu for undecided users. It's built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, featuring a clean, responsive design and a dark/light mode.

## Features

*   **Menu Recommendation:** Randomly selects a dinner menu from a diverse list of options (Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Western, etc.).
*   **Visually Appealing Display:** Displays the recommended menu clearly with a simple animation.
*   **Interactive Button:** A button to trigger the recommendation.
*   **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes.
*   **Dark/Light Mode:** A toggle to switch between dark and light themes, persisting the user's preference.

## Current Plan

*   **Refactor:** Convert the existing Lotto Number Generator into a Dinner Menu Recommender.
*   **HTML:** Update the title and container to display text instead of balls.
*   **CSS:** Adjust styles to present the menu name elegantly.
*   **JavaScript:** Replace the number generation logic with an array of food items and a random selector.
*   **Deployment:** Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
