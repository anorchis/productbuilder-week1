# Dinner Menu Recommender

## Overview

This project is a simple web application that recommends a dinner menu for undecided users. It's built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, featuring a clean, responsive design and a dark/light mode.

## Features

*   **Menu Recommendation:** Randomly selects a dinner menu from a diverse list of options (Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Western, etc.).
*   **Visually Appealing Display:** Displays the recommended menu clearly with a simple animation.

*   **Interactive Button:** A button to trigger the recommendation.
*   **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes.
*   **Dark/Light Mode:** A toggle to switch between dark and light themes, persisting the user's preference.
*   **Multi-language Support:** Allows users to switch between English and Korean for a global experience.
*   **Visual Enhancements:** Displays relevant images for specific menu items (e.g., Pizza) to provide a better user experience.

## Current Plan

*   **Internationalization (i18n):** Implement a language toggle to switch UI text and menu data between English and Korean.
*   **Refactor:** Update data structures to support multiple languages.
*   **Deployment:** Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
